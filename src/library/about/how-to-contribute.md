## It takes a ~~Village~~ Community
The maintaining the library is a lot of work. It takes a community!! Especially for bug fixes or updates from the USWDS.

Maybe you even have ideas for features to make it even better.

Join the Design Systems JAMStack community on Teams to get envolved.

## Submit a issue or a pull request
If you see a bug... please use our [Github issues](https://github.com/ux-at-icfnext/11/issues) to report. Or better yet, Fork the library and submit a pull request with the fix.
