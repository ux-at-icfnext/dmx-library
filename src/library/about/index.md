### Pattern Libraries
Use the library to store color palettes, typography, and branded components. The library should serve as the cannon for agreed upon expression of how the project makes use of the USWDS and any custom components. Make sure to take time to curate, maintain, and update patterns. If the pattern is on your site, it should be in the library -- conversly, if the patterns have been removed from the site... take time to decide whether that pattern should be sunset and then removed.

The styles & patterns section of the library contain the specifications about usage. The information included address what would be changed about the pattern in order to fit the design aethics of your project. 

<div style="color: white; background-color: #4532A2; line-width: 36px; padding: 5px;">It is highly recommended that Theme Settings be adjusted before using custom css.</div>

To learn about ux and accesibility guidance for a pattern -- please see the [USWDS Components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/).


### Prototyping
The benefits of using 11ty with the USWDS embedded is that the platform can be used to quickly create prototypes. Using the library out of the box, your prototypes can stand in as functional HTML wireframes. Adding branding to patterns (using the library functionality), allows you to create full design HTML concepts. 

Collaboration between different team skills sets allows for a iterative, agile, design in code process.

### Static Site Generator
The Nex+ Library can be used as an excellorator for a website. 11ty can be built into a pretty robust static site generator especially with adding features like search and a headless CMS. Using a static site generator (SSG) offers several advantages:

1. **Performance:** Static sites load faster because there's no need for server-side processing. With each page pre-rendered into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, loading times are significantly reduced.
Security: Since there's no backend or database to exploit, static sites are inherently more secure. There are fewer vulnerabilities compared to dynamic sites, which often interact with databases and server-side scripts.
2. **Scalability:** Static sites handle high traffic volumes well because they don't require server processing for each request. Content is served directly from the server, leading to better scalability and reduced server load.
3. **Simplicity:** Static sites are easy to set up and maintain. With no backend to manage, there's less complexity in terms of hosting, deployment, and maintenance. This makes them ideal for simple projects or projects with straightforward content needs.
4. **Version Control:** Content and code are stored in version control systems like Git, allowing for easier collaboration among team members and better control over changes. It also facilitates rollbacks to previous versions if needed.
5. **Portability:** Static sites can be hosted on various platforms, including content delivery networks (CDNs), which distribute content globally, ensuring fast loading times for users around the world.
6. **Cost-effectiveness:** Since static sites can be hosted on simpler infrastructure, they often incur lower hosting costs compared to dynamic sites, especially for low-traffic websites.
7. **Flexibility:** Many static site generators come with a wide range of plugins and themes, allowing for customization and flexibility in design and functionality.

Overall, using a static site generator can be a smart choice for projects that prioritize speed, security, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness.
