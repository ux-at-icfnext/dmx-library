## Library prototyping notes
The component is automatically included on any prototype page by setting `prototype:true` in the YAML front matter. 

To edit the component to match your project, edit the following file: `src/_includes/patterns/banner.md`.

**If the site you are working on is not a .gov or .mil site, remove the banner from your prototypes**
