## Design
### Default
{% include 'patterns/modal.md' %}

### Large
{% assign modal = modal-large %}

{% include 'patterns/modal.md' %}

### Forced
A button must be clicked to dismiss
{% assign modal = modal-forced %}

{% include 'patterns/modal.md' %}

## Theme Settings
- `$theme-modal-border-radius `: The border radius of the modal window.
- `$theme-modal-default-max-width `: Maximum width of default modal window.
- `$theme-modal-lg-max-width `: Maximum width of large modal window.
- `$theme-modal-lg-content-max-width `: Maximum width of content area within large modal window.

## Variations
- `.usa-modal--lg`: Add **.usa-modal--lg** to **.usa-modal** for a larger window and larger heading size on wider screens.


## Library prototyping notes
To use the data driven smart pattern, you'll need to set your content in the YAML front matter or in a data file.

``` yml
modal:
  id: example-modal-1
  label: Open me
  large: # optional, defaults to false
  forced:  # optional, defaults to false
  aria-label: modal-1-heading
  aria-description: modal-1-description
  title: Alice began to feel very uneasy

  button:
    - link: "#"
      text: don't click me
      class: usa-button--outline
    - link: "#"
      text: click me
```

Include the pattern using this code:

``` markdown
 {{ include }}
```
