## Design
{% include "patterns/datepicker.md" %}

### Date Range Picker
The USWDS shows both a [date picker](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/date-picker/) and [date range picker](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/date-range-picker/) as part of the design system. However, there isn't a difference between the two... the date range picker is created by simply using **two** date pickers.

## Properties
Please read further on the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/date-picker/#using-the-date-picker-component-2) about the properties and requirements of this form element.

## Library Use
Make sure to inclose the full form between the `<form class="usa-form"> </form>` tags.
