For this form element, we've combined the character count, input mask, and prefix / suffix components of the USWDS into one pattern -- as they are all aspects of an input box that we would want to put into use.

## Design
#### Default
{% include 'patterns/textinput.md' %}

#### With Masking
Options phone, soc, zip
{% assign textinput = text-phone %}
{% include 'patterns/textinput.md' %}

#### With Character limit
{% assign textinput = text-limited %}
{% include 'patterns/textinput.md' %}

#### Prefix
{% assign textinput = text-prefix %}
{% include 'patterns/textinput.md' %}

#### Suffix
{% assign textinput = text-suffix %}
{% include 'patterns/textinput.md' %}

## Library Use
Make sure to inclose the full form between the `<form class="usa-form"> </form>` tags.


**Front Matter**
``` yml
{{ yaml-sample }}
```


Include the pattern using this code:

``` markdown
 {{ include }}
```
